# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler

_Because that Rock Paper Scissors Game is Too Damn Hard_

### How it works

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to hos arrival and departure data. The app should be able to retrieve and manipulate the data using Moment.js.

The use will input data, via the form fields and populate them in the table for display while simutaneously storing the information in Firebase.
